### About the name

Naming is arguably the hardest open problem in Computer Science after P=NP, but there is no doubt that a great name is the key to a successful project. `planet` (acronym) stands for  _‘**p**rogramming **lan**guage **et**c.’_, as it is in fact a programming language that does stuff. It was also developed on a planet! And really, it just sounds good.
