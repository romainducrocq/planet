### About the name

Naming is arguably the hardest open problem in Computer Science after P=NP, but there is also no doubt that a great name is the key to a successful project. `planet` (acronym) stands for *Programming LANguage ETcetera*, as it is in fact a programming language, and it does stuff! It was also developed on a planet. And most importantly, it sounds good.
